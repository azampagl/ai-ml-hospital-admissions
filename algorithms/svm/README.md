# svm #

For comparison purposes, a generic svm (svm-light) implementation was used on the hospital data set. The results can be found in the top level directory 
as **svm.xlsx**.

## File Structure ##

* **eval.py**

This python script compares the actual hospital admission to the predicted values svm-light generated. A CSV is generated for each admission slot and the final average percent difference and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is printed out, respectively.

* **svm_classify**

  The svm-light classification executable.

* **svm_learn**

  The svm-light learning executable.

* **translate.py**

  The python scipt used to translate the feature csv file(s) (generated by the **feature-extractor**) into a format svm-light recognizes.

## Usage ##

The first step is to translate the feature set into a format svm-light recognizes:

``python translate.py``

For example, the following translates the training and test feature sets into svm format.

``python translate.py -i ../../tmp/train.features.csv -o ../../tmp/train.svm``
``python translate.py -i ../../tmp/test.features.csv -o ../../tmp/test.svm``

Next, the svm learning algorithm is ran on the **training** set and a model is generated:

``./svm_learn -z r -i 1 -t 0 ../../tmp/train.svm ../../tmp/model.svm``

After, svm-light classifies the **test** data set and predicts the admissions: 

``./svm_classify ../../tmp/test.svm ../../tmp/model.svm ../../tmp/results.svm``

Finally, the **eval** python script is executed to compare the actual and predicted admissions:

``python eval.py -f ../../tmp/test.features.csv -s ../../tmp/results.svm  -o ../../tmp/svm-results.csv``
